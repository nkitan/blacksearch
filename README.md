BlackSearch , the Tool Search for BlackArch Linux

- access to over 2000 tools
- provides easy tool discovery
- supports sh detection
- uses blackarch as base



it has bugs as of right now.
it leaves behind with the user able to grep anything outta good ol' sudo'ed pacman. This shall be our main priority(to fix, obviously). Please feel free to contribute and talk to me about it. Forking is also a thing, feel free to fork your very own custom search.
