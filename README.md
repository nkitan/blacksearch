2. Head over to blacksearch directory
3. Provide execution permissions using "chmod +x blacksearch.sh"
4. execute script using ./blacksearch.sh

------------------------------------------------ 

it has bugs as of right now.
it leaves behind with the user able to grep anything outta good ol' sudo'ed pacman. This shall be our main priority(to fix, obviously). Please feel free to contribute and talk to me about it. Forking is also a thing, feel free to fork your very own custom search.
